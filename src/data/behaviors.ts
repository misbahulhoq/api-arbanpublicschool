/**
 * This file contains training data for a machine learning model that will be
 * used to generate responses to questions about a school's environment,
 * teaching quality, and student behavior.
 *
 * The model is trained on a dataset of strings, where each string is a
 * question or statement about the school, followed by a number of possible
 * responses that the model can use to answer the question or respond to the
 * statement.
 *
 * The format of the data is as follows:
 *
 * - Each piece of training data is an object with two properties: `question`
 *   and `responses`.
 * - The `question` property is a string that contains the question or
 *   statement.
 * - The `responses` property is an array of strings, where each string is a
 *   possible response to the question or statement.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * {
 *   question: "What is the quality of the teaching at this school?",
 *   responses: [
 *     "The quality of teaching at this school is excellent.",
 *     "Teachers at this school are well-qualified and dedicated.",
 *     "The teaching at this school is good, but could be improved."
 *   ]
